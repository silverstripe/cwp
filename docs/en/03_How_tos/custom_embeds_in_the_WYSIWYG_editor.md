# Custom embeds in the WYSIWYG editor

This how-to guides developers through the steps necessary to disable default TinyMCE handling
of the `<embed>` and `<object>` tags.

Proceeding with this guide will disable the ability of the CMS to embed `.swf` files through the "Insert Media"
interface button. You will need to provide your own 
[custom TinyMCE plugins](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/3.2/developer_guides/forms/field_types/htmleditorfield) or 
embed the files directly via HTML code.

## Disable the media plugin

CMS uses the TinyMCE media plugin to embed `.swf` files. The side effect of this is that `<embed>` and `<object>` tags
are managed by the plugin which sometimes prevents custom markup to be inserted, or rewrites it with custom names
and attributes.

In your module's `_config.php` (the module's name has to be alphabetically after `cwp` for your `_config.php` statements
not to be overriden, see the notice in the [Rich Text Editing
docs](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/developer_guides/forms/field_types/htmleditorfield/)) disable the media plugin for the
default editor installed by the `cwp` module:

```php
use SilverStripe\Forms\HTMLEditor\HTMLEditorConfig;

HTMLEditorConfig::get('cwp')->disablePlugins('media');
```

Note the editor configuration we want to amend is "cwp" here, different from the default SilverStripe configuration
called "cms".

You should now be able to embed any `<embed>` or `<object>` using the HTML button in the TinyMCE editor.

## Modifying the whitelist

If you find out some attributes are still being removed by the editor, your can update the whitelist of elements.
Copy the `extended_valid_elements` option from `cwp/_config.php`, and amend it in your own `_config.php` to suit.

```php
use SilverStripe\Forms\HTMLEditor\HTMLEditorConfig;

HTMLEditorConfig::get('cwp')->setOption('extended_valid_elements', '<your modified whitelist goes here>');```
