title: Recipes and supported modules
summary: Information about the default CWP codebase referred to as the CWP recipes.

# CWP recipes

CWP supplies developers with a default set of packages for setting up their SilverStripe CMS projects.

The [Common Web Platform Installer](https://github.com/silverstripe/cwp-installer)) package is created from the original
[installer for SilverStripe CMS and Framework](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-installer). It can be used 
as a base for jump-starting development of a CWP project. This is a recommended way of creating a CWP project.

The installer comes with a `composer.json` file which defines dependencies. These make up the feature set of a default 
CWP ready website by pulling sets of commercially supported SilverStripe CMS modules. 

The [Common Web Platform Installer](https://github.com/silverstripe/cwp-installer) package includes the 
[CWP CMS Recipe](https://github.com/silverstripe/cwp-recipe-cms), 
the [CWP Search Recipe](https://github.com/silverstripe/cwp-recipe-search), 
the [Registry module](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-registry), 
the [Fluent module](https://github.com/tractorcow/silverstripe-fluent), and
the [Subsites module](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-subsites).

These 'metapackages' will be from now on referred to as "recipes", and are crucial elements of keeping your CWP 
deployment running.

## CWP recipe options

There are different recipe variations you can install for a CWP project. By default you get the kitchen sink (e.g. a 
blog even if your site doesn't need one).

</div>

## Recipe combinations

The above recipes can be combined as follows:

* Bare bones - SilverStripe plus CWP mandated configuration.
* Bare bones plus the [SilverStripe Blog Recipe](https://github.com/silverstripe/recipe-blog), or plus the [SilverStripe Form Building Recipe](https://github.com/silverstripe/recipe-form-building), etc.
* The [Common Web Platform Installer](https://github.com/silverstripe/cwp-installer) includes all of the above.
* The [CWP Agency Extensions Module](https://github.com/silverstripe/cwp-agencyextensions) can be added to any of the above.

## Theme options

There are two themes provided for the Common Web Platform 2.0 that help government agencies quickly get their sites up and running:

* The [**CWP Starter theme**](https://github.com/silverstripe/cwp-starter-theme) is a developer focused highly accessible Bootstrap 3 theme. It is suited for sites that require more customisation and a design applied with minimal restrictions.
* The [**Wātea theme**](https://github.com/silverstripe/cwp-watea-theme) includes more design elements than the CWP Starter theme. It is well suited for smaller agencies with smaller sites, smaller budgets and less developer involvement.

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown='1'>
The Wātea theme is a more "designed" subtheme which can be installed over the top of the Starter theme to provide a 
more visually appealing starter project. It also requires the [CWP Agency Extensions Module](https://github.com/silverstripe/cwp-agencyextensions) to be installed.
</div>

## Stabilising the project

Even if you did not start from the installer, you can make your project "stable" by
including the following in your `composer.json`:

```
"require": {
    "cwp/cwp-recipe-cms": "~2.0.0@stable"
    ...
```

So if the above dependency can be found in your root `composer.json` file it can be said that you are running on a
stable CWP recipe version. If you request help from the CWP Team, this will be one of the first things that will be checked - if you are not running on a stable CWP recipe, we may not be able to easily help you.

You may add more modules to your project by modifying your base `composer.json`. Please note that these modules will
interact with the recipe, so you need to test for regressions as only the base combination of packages is tested in the CWP recipe
release process.

## Can I remove the default recipes?

We strongly recommend using the supported SilverStripe and CWP recipes that come by default with a CWP installation.

The reasons include:

* Reused code makes maintenance simple - it's easier to apply security updates
* The CWP Service Desk might not be able to help you if you are on a heavily customised codebase
* Custom code is usually less stable than the one that's frequently used
* Advertised CWP features may not work
* Your site may break when infrastructure changes are rolled out - these changes will only be tested against the official CWP recipe releases

You are welcome to remove recipes or features from the list of dependencies that are not required for your project. 

If after careful consideration your development team decides to depart from the recipe model, it is recommended to pull
in at least the [CWP CMS recipe](https://github.com/silverstripe/cwp-recipe-cms). If even this doesn't work for you, the last resort is
including the [CWP Core recipe](https://github.com/silverstripe/cwp-recipe-core). This at least will ensure the minimal compatibility

with the platform infrastructure and will allow us to deliver some subset of fixes and features to you as they are released.

Your development team will need to follow the releases of the recipe on their own and make sure the modules are either
updated, or the issues acknowledged as not posing security or technical risk.

## Recipe releases

We use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org) for the SilverStripe Framework, CMS and supported modules. In CWP recipes we use major, minor and point
releases. From time to time the fourth level - micro (1.2.3.4) - might be used if more granularity is needed.

Stable recipe releases will often be released alongside a stable release of the core SilverStripe framework and CMS, but
we may also release new features or bugfixes for CWP independently of this.

If we announce a new point/micro recipe release (e.g. if you are on 1.0.1, these will be 1.0.1.1, 1.0.1.2, 1.0.2,
1.0.2.1 and so forth) you will need to upgrade, test and deploy your updated project code within a relatively short
timeframe which will be specified on the release notification. While such point/micro releases will be
backwards-compatible and should not break any existing APIs, we still recommend at least running a few smoke tests on your
UAT environment or dev machine before deploying to production.

As a rule of thumb you need to remain on the latest point/minor release version of the recipe to receive all security
fixes.

Major and minor recipe releases (if you are on 1.0.1 these will be 1.1.0, 1.2.0, 2.0.0 and so on) could take more time
to apply. One old minor and one old major branch will still receive security patches, so you have more time to do these.
We estimate that on a small site you may need to spend a day upgrading to a new minor version, and a few days or more
upgrading to a new major version.

The CWP support team may in some situations hot-patch (possibly in a destructive way) your site or pull an environment down if it is
found to endanger other sites on the CWP infrastructure. The timeframe in which this could happen will be specified on the release
notification.

See the [upgrading guide](upgrading) for instructions.

## Recipe contents

To obtain the composition of the latest stable recipes, the easiest way is to head to the
[recipe repositories](https://github.com/topics/silverstripe-recipes) and look at the respective composer file and the dependencies
contained there.

For example, [here is the blog recipe contents](https://github.com/silverstripe/recipe-blog/blob/master/composer.json).

To find the location of a specific repository check on [Packagist](http://packagist.org/).

## Dev recipe

The installer's `composer.json` also provides a single "dev" metapackage dependency for CWP:

```
"require-dev": {
    "cwp/cwp-recipe-basic-dev": "~2.0.0@stable"
    ...
```

[cwp-recipe-basic-dev](https://github.com/silverstripe/cwp-recipe-basic-dev) pulls in dev dependencies specific for
development based on the CWP codebase. These packages will NOT be installed on the environments (neither prod, UAT nor
test). You can also elect not to install it by specifying `--no-dev` with your `composer install` or `composer update`
commands on your local dev machine.
