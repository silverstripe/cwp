introduction: Describes how to use CWP centralised logging

# Centralised logging

The logs for each environment you have on CWP are collected and stored in a
centralised installation of Graylog.

You can access Graylog using your CWP log-in at the following URL:
[https://logs.cwp.govt.nz/](https://logs.cwp.govt.nz/).

In order to gain access to these logs please raise a general support request with the [CWP Service Desk](https://www.cwp.govt.nz/service-desk/new-request/).

We provide a stream for each environment. Streams are where
you can view and query the stored logs. These include Apache, PHP, and any
custom events that you want to log.

## Searching

Each search requires a time period to search and
query strings (the default is 5 minutes). The query string uses Graylog's query syntax which you can find out more about by reading [Graylog documentation](http://docs.graylog.org/en/latest/pages/queries.html).

To get you started with Graylog there are some predefined searches you can
select from the top right corner. These are:

* Apache Access Logs
* PHP Errors (Notice, Warning, Fatal)

Following are a couple of examples on search queries:

 - Find logs of a certain type:

    `log_type:apache`

 - Find web requests for the url "/about-us/":

    `http_url:"/about-us/"`

 - Find web requests that begins with "/about-us/":

    `http_url:\/about-us\/*`

    Note that the following characters needs to be escaped with a backslash:

    `&& || : \ / + - ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ?`

 - Find web requests that resulted in a 5xx error response:
 
    `http_response:>=500`

 - Find web requests that resulted in a 4xx error response:

    `http_response:(>=400 AND <500)`

## Log types

CWP environments will automatically write several log types which can be searched with the `log_type` keyword in Graylog, as
long as the project includes the `cwp-core` module.

* `SilverStripe_log`: standard log output of the Framework, will capture all events occurring after successful Framework
bootstrap. This includes uncaught exceptions and any `Injector::inst()->get(LoggerInterface::class)->...` events.
* `SilverStripe_audit`: audit trail of security-related events provided by the *silverstripe/auditor* module.
* `apache`: apache access logs.
* `apache-errors`: errors reported by Apache, which could include `mod_php` segmentation faults.
* `php`: PHP errors logged by the PHP binary directly, such as command-line PHP execution.

## Analysis of logs

Graylog provides several tools to analyse your search results. To analyse a 
field from your search results, expand the field in the search sidebar and click
on the button of the analysis you want to perform.

### Field statistics

You can compute different statistics on your fields, to help you better summarise and 
understand the data in them.

The statistical information consists of: total, mean, minimum, maximum, standard
deviation, variance, sum, and cardinality. On non-numeric fields, you can only
see the total amount of messages containing that field, and the cardinality of
the field, i.e. the number of unique values it has.

### Quick values
You can use quick values to help you find out the distribution of values for a field. 
Alongside a graphic representation of the common values contained in a field, 
Graylog will display a table with all different values, allowing you to see the
number of times they appear. You can include any value in your search query by
clicking on the magnifying glass icon located in the value row.

### Field graphs
You can create field graphs for any numeric field, by clicking on the Generate
chart button in the search sidebar. Using the options in the Customize menu on
top of the field graph, you can change the statistical function used in the 
graph, the kind of graph to use to represent the values, the graph
interpolation, as well as the time resolution.

For more information see [Graylog analysis documentation](http://docs.graylog.org/en/stable/pages/queries.html#analysis).

## Logging custom events

The recipes are configured to send all logs to syslog, which are then accessible through Graylog. The recommended way
to log events on CWP is through the SilverStripe logging API:

```php
use Psr\Log\LoggerInterface;
use SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Injector;

// ...

Injector::inst()->get(LoggerInterface::class)->notice('Something seems to have happened');
```

For more information on general usage of the Framework's logging subsystem, see
the [logging in SilverStripe documentation](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/developer_guides/debugging/error_handling/).

## Custom audit trail

Aside from regular logs, you can add custom events to the audit trail. Please follow the instructions provided with the
[silverstripe/auditor](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-auditor#custom-audit-trail) module.
