summary: Considerations and steps to keep your website secure.

# Security

This section describes security considerations, as well as additional steps that may be taken to further secure a
website.

### API endpoint

By default the SilverStripe API endpoint is exposed publicly, to lock down access to the API endpoint you can add
the following to your `app/_config/api.yml` file:

```yaml
CWP\CWP\PageTypes\BasePage:
  api_access: false
```

## User login considerations

### Login auto-completion

By default the username of anyone who logs into the website is saved in their browser's autocomplete cache when logging into a website. This username, by default, is the email address. If necessary, the autocompletion by the browser can be disabled on the 'Email' field by setting `SilverStripe\Security\Security.remember_username` to false.

This is done in your `app/_config/config.yml` file, by adding the following:

```yaml
SilverStripe\Security\Security:
  remember_username: false
```
Note that if a user has already saved their username prior to changing this value, it may be necessary to reset their browser autocomplete history before this will take effect.

This setting does not affect the behaviour of the browser's built in password manager or third-party password manager auto-filling the stored credentials.

Disabling the browser autocomplete functionality does make the email field more susceptible to malicious keyloggers capturing the email address/username.

The password field has autocomplete from the browser's autocomplete cache disabled by default for security reasons.

### User session expiration

After logging in, any user will remain in an active state as long as there is no extended period of inactivity.
In order to reduce the risk that active browser sessions may be exploited, it may be necessary
to reduce the timeout period for each session. By default, active sessions will expire after 24 minutes of inactivity.
This value may be adjusted by setting the `SilverStripe\Control\Session.timeout` value (in units of seconds).

For instance, to set the session timeout to 10 minutes add the following to your `app/_config/config.yml` file:

```yaml
SilverStripe\Control\Session:
  timeout: 600
```
Note: Setting this value to zero will instead terminate the session when the user closes their browser window,
but this does not enforce any maximum session duration.

Note: This value adjusts how long a user's _browser_ remembers the session. To adjust how long the server remembers
sessions, you will have to adjust your `php.ini` configuration setting `session.gc_maxlifetime`. More information can be
found at [php's session configuration page](http://www.php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php#ini.session.gc-maxlifetime).
A lifetime of 24 minutes matches the default timeout configuration on CWP.

### Saved user logins

Users have the option to check a box during login labeled "Remember me next time?"
If checked, that user will remain logged into the site even after the browser has been closed, and will be
automatically logged in when they come back at a later time, up to a maximum period of 30 days by default.
For sites running less than version 2.8 of CWP, this value is 90 days by default. This time period can be modified via
the `SilverStripe\Security\RememberLoginHash.token_expiry_days` config setting.

If the computer used is not physically secured, it may be necessary to disable this feature to prevent
subsequent users from automatically logging in and impersonating someone else. This is done by setting
the `SilverStripe\Security\Security.autologin_enabled` setting to false.

In your `app/_config/config.yml` file, add the following:

```yaml
SilverStripe\Security\Security:
  autologin_enabled: false
```

If the browser is closed, and the session has expired, subsequent attempts to access secured content
will require a username and password.

## File upload restrictions

The `SilverStripe\Assets\File.allowed_extensions` config value specifies the list of all file types allowed to be saved into
the assets folder. By default this includes file types such as html, and in some cases it may represent a
security risk to allow these file types. See the
[OWASP wiki on File Upload](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Unrestricted_File_Upload) for details.

Individual extensions may be added using this configuration in your `app/_config/mimetypes.yml` file:

```yaml
SilverStripe\Assets\File:
  allowed_extensions:
    - xhtml
    - xml
```

From CWP 2.1 onwards, you can also remove extensions:

```yaml
SilverStripe\Assets\File:
  allowed_extensions:
    xml: false
```

Uploaded files have their extension checked against known MIME types in the `HTTP.MimeTypes` config setting.
This basically means the file contents are checked to ensure the extension matches. For example, if you rename an image
`test.jpg` to `test.txt` and attempt to upload it, the file will be rejected.

Please see [technical docs for adding extensions](/how_tos/adding_an_allowed_extension) for more information on
allowing new file extensions and MIME types.

### Front-end authentication

If it's necessary to require secure authentication to certain areas of the front end (such as
password protected forms or information) then there are some configuration changes that must be made.

By default all attempts to access secure pages will redirect the user to an SSL protected domain
specific to that environment (e.g. mystack.cwp.govt.nz). This is in place to prevent
users wishing to access the CMS having to log in for each individual domain, as well as the
dependency on each domain having its own SSL certificate.

In the case that the user wishes to access content on the front-end of a specific domain, however,
it's necessary that the user logs into that one, rather than the designated secure login domain.

To disable the redirection add the following to `app/_config/security.yml`:

```yaml
---
Name: mysitesecurity
After: '#cwpsslredirectdomain'
---
SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Injector:
  SilverStripe\Control\Middleware\CanonicalURLMiddleware:
    properties:
      ForceSSLDomain: false
```

In this case it is necessary to ensure that an SSL certificate has been purchased and configured
for each domain. If you are unsure, contact the [CWP Service Desk](https://www.cwp.govt.nz/service-desk/).

Alternatively, you can completely disable SSL redirection by setting the `CanonicalURLMiddleware.ForceSSL` property to false via Injector configuration (as in the example above). However, any data accessed or submitted by users would be unencrypted.

## HTTP Security Headers

### Strict Transport Security

The [HTTP Strict Transport Security](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) (HSTS)
headers are an important security mechanism to reduce the chance of man-in-the-middle
attacks, by signaling to browsers that requests to the site should always
be encrypted (via accessing on the `https://` protocol).

CWP environments can always be accessed
via SSL, either through agency-provided certificates, or free certificates
provided through the Let's Encrypt service ([details](https://www.cwp.govt.nz/working-with-cwp/instance-management/ssl-certificates/)).
CWP websites already enforce the `https://` protocol for authenticated requests,
e.g. to `Security/*` and `admin/*`.

Starting with CWP 2.4, new projects will
automatically be configured to send HSTS headers, and redirect all requests to `https://`. Projects created prior to CWP 2.4 can opt-in to this behaviour by copying
the new default configuration into their existing projects:
[app/_config/security.yml](https://github.com/silverstripe/cwp-installer/blob/master/app/_config/security.yml).

The default short-lived `max-age` for these headers is considered less secure,
and should be increased once you are confident that your website operates correctly
under SSL with HSTS for all domains. Please refer to [OWASP recommendations](https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security_Cheat_Sheet.md)
for secure `max-age` values (usually 365 days).

Note: This will only secure requests to SilverStripe.
In order to protect access to static assets,
consider adding HSTS headers to your `.htaccess` file,
and ensure that every environment (incl. local development)
are able to serve your site on the `https://` protocol.

### Content-Security-Policy, X-XSS-Protection and more

There are other HTTP security headers that you should consider
to increase the security of your site. We recommend that you scan
your site on [securityheaders.com/](https://securityheaders.com/)
and implement additional headers depending on your use case
through `.htaccess` configuration.

Since SilverStripe is an extensible system, modules added
to your website or CMS might embed resources from other domains
which influence the settings on your particular website.
Common examples are videos embedded from youtube.com,
analytics loaded from google-analytics.com,
or captchas provided through spam protection modules
and loaded e.g. from google.com.

## HTTP request proxies and filtering

### Whitelist embedded resource domains {#whitelist-embed-domains}

The SilverStripe CMS allows CMS users to embed external content such as YouTube or Vimeo videos in page content.
CWP recommends that you configure a whitelist of allowed domains to embed content from. If you aren't using this
feature then we recommend you configure the domain whitelist anyway.

Please ensure you use the HTTPS protocol on domains wherever possible.

```yaml
---
Name: mysiteembedproviders
---
SilverStripe\AssetAdmin\Forms\RemoteFileFormFactory:
  # Disable http protocol, prefer https
  fileurl_scheme_blacklist:
    - http
  fileurl_port_blacklist:
    - 80

  # Specify a whitelist of domains to allow embedded resources from
  fileurl_domain_whitelist:
    - youtube.com
    - vimeo.com
    - videoprovider.cwp.govt.nz

  # Optionally, blacklist specific domains
  fileurl_domain_blacklist:
    - knowndangerousdomain.com
```
