# Customising the CWP Starter theme

## Introduction

CWP provides a *CWP Starter* theme for you to work with. This has been developed both as a base for more complex themes to
be built on top of and as a reference example for meeting Government standards and accessibility guidelines.

For more information on how a SilverStripe theme is constructed, see the [Developing
Themes](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/developer_guides/templates/themes/) page in the SilverStripe documentation.

When customising the theme, you can choose to work either with the powerful SASS framework (as explained below), or to
use the CSS stylesheets directly. In the latter case we recommend you to remove the `.scss` files to make it clear they are
not used.

We recommend you follow the CWP Starter theme as a guideline and use the provided npm configuration to build and recompile your frontend dependencies.

Note: The Starter theme is the default CWP theme as of the CWP 1.6 recipe. If you are looking for the old "default" CWP theme, [please see here](https://www.cwp.govt.nz/developer-docs/en/1.5/working_with_projects/customising_the_default_theme/).

## Getting Started

The CWP Starter theme that comes with the basic site is cloned from the [CWP Starter theme in GitHub](https://github.com/silverstripe/cwp-starter-theme), so you are not able to
make changes to it directly. There are two recommended ways of creating your own theme:

### Forking the theme

This will give you a copy of the CWP Starter theme repository that you can edit and can share with others.

1. Browse to the [CWP Starter theme](https://github.com/silverstripe/cwp-starter-theme) in GitHub.
2. Click on the *Fork* button in the toolbar. This will make a copy of the theme in your GitHub profile.
3. Your forked repository has inherited the starter theme's public access. To disable this, go to the settings page.
(*Settings / Edit Project*) of your repository in Gitlab, change the *Project Visibility* option as required and click *Save*.
4.  In your theme's `composer.json` file and change the `"name"` parameter to `"my-agency/<theme-name-here>"`.
5.  In your project's `composer.json` replace `"cwp/starter-theme"` with with the name you added in the previous step.
6.  In the same `composer.json` file replace the `"https://github.com/silverstripe/cwp-starter-theme"` with your
private repository address to the `repositories` array - see below for sample. You may need to add this manually.
7.  Edit the `mysite/_config/config.yml` file and change the theme from `starter` to your theme's name.
8.  Run `composer update`.

#### Example composer.json files

Your theme's composer.json file should look something like this:

	{
		"name": "my-agency/my-new-theme",
		"description": "My New Theme",
		"type": "silverstripe-theme",
		"require": {
			"silverstripe/framework": "^4.0"
		},
		"extra": {
			"branch-alias": {
				"dev-master": "2.x-dev"
			}
		}
	}

Your project's composer.json file should look something like this:

	{
		"name": "my-agency/my-project",
		"description": "My CWP project",
		"require": {
			"cwp/cwp-recipe-cms": "~2.0.0@stable",
			"my-agency/my-new-theme": "dev-master"
		},
		"require-dev": {
			"cwp/cwp-recipe-basic-dev": "1.0.1"
		},
		"config": {
			"process-timeout": 900
		},
		"repositories": [
			{
				"type": "vcs",
				"url": "https://gitlab.cwp.govt.nz/my-agency/my-new-theme.git",
				"private": "true"
			}
		],
		"minimum-stability": "dev",
		"prefer-stable": true
	}

That will have you set up with your own copy of the theme in the folder `/themes/my-new-theme`. You can also share your
theme with others by adding them as team members to your project, or even making the repository public.

Note the `"private": "true"` switch for your custom theme - this switch is needed to be able to deploy non-public,
GitLab hosted modules. See [Working with modules](06_Working_with_modules.md) for more information on this features.

### Committing a theme to your project repository

This is a more straightforward process but not as flexible - you won't be able to share the theme with anyone that you
also don't want to have access to your site's code as well, and will make it more difficult to update when the CWP Starter theme is updated.

 1. Edit your project's `.gitignore` file and remove the `themes/` line.
 2. Remove the `/themes/starter/.git` directory and the `/themes/starter/.gitignore` file.
 3. Rename the "starter" folder to your projects name (it should be all lower case and preferably one word).
  * If you're also using the [WƒÅtea theme](https://github.com/silverstripe/cwp-watea-theme) you will also need to 
  change "starter" to your projects name in the "starter_watea" folder. You may also wish to change the "watea" part of 
  that folder name to your own customised subtheme name as well. Note that if you change the theme name from "watea" to 
  something else you will need to update it in your `theme.yml` file as well
 4. Add the `.gitignore` file and the `themes` folder to your git project, commit it and push it back to the upstream 
 repository.
 5. Remove the "cwp/starter-theme" line from the **require** list in `composer.json`. This will prevent composer from 
 re-adding the *starter* theme to your project.
 6. Edit `mysite/_config/theme.yml` and add your theme name to the list in `SilverStripe\View\SSViewer.themes`. 
 If you're using the public webroot feature (enabled by default from CWP 2.0 onwards) ensure you add your custom theme
  _after_ `'$public'`.

Don't forget to `flush` by visiting `http://localhost/your-project/?flush=1` to get the new theme running!

Commit all changed files to your project repository so other collaborators can see it. This will include `composer.lock` file
that "freezes" the current version of the modules to the ones you have currently included.

	$ git add --all
	$ git commit -m "Add custom theme."
	$ git push origin master

Now when you go into GitLab, you'll see a commit from yourself "Add custom theme."

## Bootstrap

The CWP Starter theme is built on top of a fork of the [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/)
front-end framework.

Bootstrap is a free collection of tools for creating websites and web applications. It contains HTML and
CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, charts, navigation and other interface components, as well
as optional JavaScript extensions. Bootstrap was originally written in Less, but has been ported to Sass. This theme
uses the Sass port of Bootstrap.

From Bootstrap's [Getting Started page](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/) you can find links about the basics of the system
and the full documentation.

The CWP Starter theme's npm dependencies include the Bootstrap Sass files, and the compiled CSS output also includes the final output.

### Bootstrap in the *CWP Starter* theme

If you just want to dive in without reading the manual, the most important thing to understand is the [grid
system](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/#grid). In a nutshell, `.row` is a full-width
container that can contain 12 columns. Elements define the number of columns they take up by using `.col-*-*` classes, where an asterisk is replaced with a [viewport reference](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/#grid-options), and the other is replaced with the number of columns between 1 and 12. Take a look at the simple example in
`/themes/starter/templates/Layout/Page.ss` and see how the sidenav and content sit beside each other.

The basic page layout uses a `.col-md-7` on the left for the content and a `.col-md-3` for the main content area. The `.col-md-offset-1` class creates an indent for the content on the left side of the page.

## Sass and Javascript

The CWP Starter theme is build using Bootstrap's Sass source code to compile a customised version of Bootstrap, where colours, margins, paddings etc are modified and recompiled within the context of the rest of Bootstrap's source code.

We've added very little CSS and JS to the core Bootstrap 3 feature set, but that which we have added is neatly packaged in the theme folder. The files are built using a build chain abstraction, called [Laravel Mix](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/mix). It uses [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io) to convert, combine, minify and improve the quality of CSS and JS files.

Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) is a preprocessed stylesheet language, compiling to CSS. Sass adds nested
rules, variables, mixins, selector inheritance, functions and other such useful things to CSS3. SCSS is a syntax of
Sass based on CSS syntax.

For more information on how to use SCSS, and full API documentation see: http://sass-lang.com/.

If you take a look at the `webpack.mix.js` file in the `themes/starter` folder, you will see some instructions for how the Sass and Javascript files are loaded, processed, combined and/or minified then pushed to a "dist" file.

An example folder structure might look like this:

```
themes/starter/
    dist/
	    css/
		    main.css
		js/
		    main.js
	src/
	    scss/
		    components/
			    my-component.scss
		    main.scss
		js/
			components/
				my-component.js
			main.js
```

In the above example, the "src" files are all loaded and processed (although there is only one in the example) and a combined and rendered output file is added to the respective "dist" folder. When referencing frontend assets from templates and `Requirements` calls you should use the "dist" files.

### Installing Webpack and Laravel Mix

You'll need to have a recent versions of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for this build chain to work. We recommend Node `v7.x` or later and npm `v4.x` or later. You can check which version you have by running `node -v` and `npm version`.

Once you have npm installed, you can install the required package dependencies for the theme:

```
cd themes/starter
npm install
```

You should now have the required tools installed. You can see what the package requires by inspecting `package.json` in the theme directory - an example `package.json` might contain a section like this:

```
"dependencies": {
  "bootstrap-sass": "^3.3.7",
  "expose-loader": "^0.7",
  "font-awesome": "^4.7.0",
  "jquery": "^3.1.1",
  "jquery-highlight": "^3.3.0",
  "laravel-mix": "^0.5"
},
"devDependencies": {
  "babel-eslint": "^7.1.1",
  "eslint": "^3.13.1",
  "eslint-config-airbnb": "^14.0.0",
  "eslint-plugin-import": "^2.2.0",
  "eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y": "^3.0.2",
  "eslint-plugin-react": "^6.9.0",
  "sass-lint": "^1.10.2",
  "webpack": "^2"
}
```

To validate that they have been installed correctly, run a test build:

```
npm run build
```

You should see "OK" in the console if everything compiled correctly.

Building the bundled files can be slow, especially as you add much more code. Instead, consider running the file watcher (in a background tab) so that the bundles can be partially rebuilt as needed: `npm run watch`.

If you have any questions about how to customise Laravel Mix, take a look at the [official documentation](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix/tree/master/docs).

### Adding JS and CSS files

If you want to add new Sass (CSS styles) or Javascript functionality you should create a new "component" in the "src/scss|js/components" folder of the theme and add a reference to it from the `main.scss` or `main.js` file in the folder above it, for example:

**File:** themes/starter/src/scss/components/my-component.scss
```
.my-parent-selector {
  .my-child-selector {
    // Make the text colour green!
    color: green;
  }
}
```

And add the following to src/scss/main.scss:

```
@import "./components/my-component";
```

You can follow the same process for Javascript files - take a look at the existing components for examples.

It's generally encouraged to use Sass variables wherever possible. You can find a list of all predefined variables and values in the src/scss/variables.scss file. This file is based on the default Bootstrap 3 variable sheet, with some changes made and some new variables added.

Once you have added the new components, changed styles etc, you should run `npm run build` to compile and produce the "dist" files. On successful completion you can add and commit your updates files.

**Note:** When working in a team environment it will not be uncommon to have merge conflicts in dist files. If this happens and conflicts are confined to dist files, simply run `npm run build` again and add the rebuilt files.

### Building for production

When you're about to release a new production-ready version of your theme you should run the "package" process instead. This will perform a build, but will also minify the output to decrease the overall file size and help keep your website as speedy as possible:

```
npm run package
```

## Modifying template files

The CWP Starter and WƒÅtea themes are built with the same [template syntax SilverStripe developers are used to](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/developer_guides/templates). Here's what has been changed from the previous "default" theme:

* Use [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com) HTML and CSS, instead of Bootstrap 2
* Use a new, simplified build chain ([Laravel Mix](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/mix))
* Perform a full accessibility review (with external assessors)
* Add translatable strings for all hard-coded template text

Given these changes, all you need to do to modify the theme is dive into the template files in the theme located in the `templates` folder of the theme.

When you make changes to a template, be sure to flush the site cache (by appending `flush=1` to the query string.

## Working with standards

In his book [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0132350882), Robert Martin talks about the importance of reading code vs. writing code. That what we write needs to be entirely focused on being easy to read and understand. That writing something succinctly is a waste of time if the effort makes understanding it harder.

That's the main reason that the CWP Starter and WƒÅtea themes have opted to use [AirBnB code styles for Javascript]](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript] and  [AirBnB CSS/Sass styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/css) for Sass and CSS (with a minor adjustment to follow Bootstrap's class naming convention of single dashes rather than BEM). You don't have to use these, in your project, but if you do all of your code will resemble the style used in the Sass and JS theme files.

## Javascript linting

The [AirBnB JS code style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) is applied, using [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint).

> This assumes you're going for AirBnB Javascript code styles. You can of course configure ESLint to your preferred standard.

It would also help if you configured ESLint to allow global variables (like `window` and `document`):

**File:** `.eslintrc`
```json
{
    "extends": "airbnb",
    "rules": {
        "func-names": "off"
    },
    "env": {
        "browser": true,
        "node": true,
        "jasmine": true
    }
}
```

You can run Javascript linting from the command line:

```
npm run-script lint-js
```

You can also install an ESLint plugin for your IDE.

## SASS linting

This theme comes with configuration for the [sass-lint](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint) npm module. You can run linting over the SASS files in this theme with the following command:

```
npm run lint-sass
```

The style rules are based on the [AirBnB CSS/Sass style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/css). The exception is the BEM class naming rules, which has been substituted for Bootstrap-style class naming rules for compatibility with its framework. For example a BEM class name such as `.ListingCard__content` would be better suited here written a `.listingcard-content`.

If you want to change the pre-configured rules for the linter, you can adjust the `.sass-lint.yml` file in the theme's root directory.
