# CWP Recipe 1.1.0

## Overview

This release tracks the Framework release 3.1.13. There are several security fixes and major features included.

Please see the changelogs for these following releases for the list of core changes since recipe 1.0.7

 * [framework 3.1.13](http://doc.silverstripe.org/en/changelogs/3.1.13/)

## New Features and Modules

The following new major features are included in this release:

 * Full blogging support, including nested comments, moderation tools, and multi-user functionality. Details on the new blog recipe can be found on the [blog recipe](/cwp-features/blog_recipe) page.
 * The ability to index and search uploaded documents via fulltext search. This is currently a beta feature, and any agency using this is advised to complete feasibility testing on any target environment. Details on configuring your environments for searching documents can be found on the [solr search](/cwp-features/solr_search) page.
 * A Single Sign-On functionality for SilverStripe intranet sites has been created. It is optional functionality and will require specific infrastructural architecture. See the [single sign on documentation](/cwp-features/single_sign_on).

Also included is a new file-tracking system to display which pages each image appears on.

## Upgrading Instructions

In order to assist agencies to upgrade their existing sites without the inclusion of new 1.1.0 blog features,
these have been separated into a new module, [cwp-recipe-blog](https://gitlab.cwp.govt.nz/cwp/cwp-recipe-blog),
which can be optionally excluded from any upgrade if desired.

Document searching and Active Directory are supported but not installed by default, and thus can be excluded from
any upgrade.

In order to update an existing site to use the new basic recipe the following changes to your composer.json
can be made:


	"require": {
		"cwp/cwp-recipe-basic": "~1.1.0@stable",
		"cwp-themes/default": "~1.1.0@stable"
	}


Inclusion of the new blogging recipe requires both the above upgrade step, as well as the separate recipe requirement:


	"require": {
		"cwp/cwp-recipe-blog": "~1.1.0@stable"
	}

### Accepted failing tests

#### framework

 * DirectorTest.testAlternativeBaseURL - Test passes locally when run in
 isolation.

 Requirements combining the same file twice, non-critical Framework issue.
 * UploadTest.testUploadTarGzFileTwiceAppendsNumber — This test is now expected
 to fail as the new MimeValidator module will no longer allow random content to
 be uploaded with a mismatched mime and file extension. The original test is
 attempting to upload a bunch of text as a gzip file.

 state, passes locally when the test is run individually.

 when run in isolation.

 combining the same file twice. Non-critical Framework issue.
