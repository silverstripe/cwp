# 2.8.0

## Overview

This release includes [Silverstripe CMS Recipe version 4.8.0](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/changelogs/4.8.0/).

## Removed module

The [`bringyourownideas/silverstripe-composer-security-checker`](https://github.com/bringyourownideas/silverstripe-composer-security-checker) will no longuer ship with CWP. While it's unusual for a module to be removed from CWP, `bringyourownideas/silverstripe-composer-security-checker` has been rendered useless by the end-of-life of [SensioLabs Security Check Web service](https://github.com/sensiolabs/security-checker)
