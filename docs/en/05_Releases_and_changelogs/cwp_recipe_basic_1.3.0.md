# CWP Recipe 1.3.0

## Overview

This recipe includes a new minor release of CMS and Framework to version 3.3.1.

Please see the changelogs for these following releases for the list of core changes since recipe 1.2.0

 * [framework 3.3.0](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/3.3/changelogs/3.3.0/)
 * [framework 3.3.1](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/3.3/changelogs/3.3.1/)

It is not mandatory that agencies upgrade to this release. In general, if you are unsure if you
need to upgrade to this release, it is safe to wait until your next scheduled upgrade cycle.

## New Features

The upgrade to CMS and Framework 3.3 introduces a major UX overhaul with improved handling
in the following areas:

- Ability to search pages in all edit views.
- Updated look and feel, with most elements receiving a theme overhaul.
- Additional security features to help construct and manage versioned DataObjects
- Additional security on the ?stage=Stage querystring parameter. Now by default, only users
    with any of the following permissions may set this option:
  - "Access to all CMS sections"
  - "Access to Pages section"
  - "View draft content"

For more information on how to prepare your existing code for compatibility with 3.3, please review
[the 3.3 changelog](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/3.3/changelogs/3.3.0/) for specific upgrading instructions.

## Details of security issues

This release includes fixes for the following issues:

 * [ss-2015-019](http://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/ss-2015-019): In some cases, user
   code which applies Versioned extension to DataObjects may expose non-public content, unless an
   appropriate canView is implemented which checks access for the current stage.
   This is a risk in cases that the site is put into staging mode by an unauthenticated user.
   In 3.3.0 versioned dataobjects will now automatically have a default security model which denies draft
   access to public users, and directly blocks access to the stage mode via the querystring.
 * [ss-2016-003](http://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/ss-2016-003): In it's default
   configuration, SilverStripe trusts all originating IPs to include HTTP headers for Hostname, IP and
   Protocol. This enables reverse proxies to forward requests while still retaining the original request
   information. Trusted IPs can be limited via the SS_TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS constant. Even with this
   restriction in place, SilverStripe trusts a variety of HTTP headers due to different proxy notations
   (e.g. X-Forwarded-For vs. Client-IP). Unless a proxy explicitly unsets invalid HTTP headers from
   connecting clients, this can lead to spoofing requests being passed through trusted proxies.
   The impact of spoofed headers can include Director::forceSSL() not being enforced,
   SS_HTTPRequest->getIP() returning a wrong IP (disabling any IP restrictions), and spoofed hostnames
   circumventing any hostname-specific restrictions enforced in SilverStripe Controllers.
 * [ss-2015-028](http://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/ss-2015-028): The buildDefaults
   method on DevelopmentAdmin is missing a permission check. In live mode, if you access /dev/build,
   you are requested to login first. However, if you access /dev/build/defaults, then the action is
   performed without any login check. This should be protected in the same way that /dev/build is.
   The buildDefaults view is requireDefaultRecords() on each DataObject class, and hence has the
   potential to modify database state. It also lists all modified tables, allowing attackers more
   insight into which modules are used, and how the database tables are structured.
 * [ss-2016-002](http://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/ss-2016-002): GridField does
   not have sufficient CSRF protection, meaning that in some cases users with CMS access can be tricked
   into posting unspecified data into the CMS from external websites. Amongst other default CMS interfaces,
   GridField is used for management of groups, users and permissions in the CMS.
   The resolution for this issue is to ensure that all gridFieldAlterAction submissions are checked
   for the SecurityID token during submission.

## Note on issues on sites supporting large numbers of files

Additional documentation on how to improve performance in the asset admin has been added under
[Supporting large numbers of files](/how_tos/supporting_large_numbers_of_files)

## Upgrading Instructions

In order to update an existing site to use the new basic recipe the following changes to your composer.json
can be made:

### Known issues

In recipe 1.3.0 there are the following known issues in these failing tests:

#### framework

 * FolderTest.testRenameFolderAndCheckTheFile - Known compatibility issue in versionedfiles
   with 3.2. See https://github.com/silverstripe-australia/silverstripe-versionedfiles/issues/43
 * FolderTest.testSetNameChangesFilesystemOnWrite - Known compatibility issue in versionedfiles
   with 3.2. See https://github.com/silverstripe-australia/silverstripe-versionedfiles/issues/43
 * FolderTest.testSetParentIDChangesFilesystemOnWrite - Known compatibility issue in versionedfiles
   with 3.2. See https://github.com/silverstripe-australia/silverstripe-versionedfiles/issues/43
   
#### userforms

 * UserFormsUpgradeServiceTest.testCustomSettingsMigration - Initial migration may sometimes fail
   to create the initial step. See https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-userforms/issues/431

### Accepted failing tests

In recipe 1.3.0 these module unit tests cause external errors, but do not represent legitimate issues.

#### framework

 * UploadFieldTest.testAllowedExtensions — Behaviour intentionally altered by the MimeValidator module
 * UploadFieldTest.testSelect — Behaviour altered by SelectUploadField intentionally
 * UploadTest.testUploadTarGzFileTwiceAppendsNumber — This test is now expected
   to fail as the new MimeValidator module will no longer allow random content to
   be uploaded with a mismatched mime and file extension. The original test is
   attempting to upload a bunch of text as a gzip file.

#### queuedjobs

 * QueuedJobsTest.testImmediateQueuedJob - Test self-aborts when detecting lack of available system
   resources (inconclusive).
 * QueuedJobsTest.testStartJob - Test self-aborts when detecting lack of available system
   resources (inconclusive).

#### translatable

 * TranslatableSearchFormTest.testPublishedPagesMatchedByTitleInDefaultLanguage - Test failure
   affected by global state. See https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-translatable/issues/223
 * TranslatableSiteConfigTest.testCanEditTranslatedRootPages - Test failure affected by global state.
   See https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-translatable/issues/224
