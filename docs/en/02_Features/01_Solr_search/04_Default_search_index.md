title: Default CWP search index
summary: Information about how the Solr search index is pre-configured for CWP.

## Default CWP search index

By default, a standard search index `CWP\Search\Solr\CwpSolrIndex` is included in the default recipe.
This includes basic configuration necessary for searching pages.

```php
namespace CWP\Search\Solr;

use CWP\Search\CwpSearchIndex;
use SilverStripe\CMS\Model\SiteTree;

class CwpSolrIndex extends CwpSearchIndex
{
    public function init()
    {
        $this->addClass(SiteTree::class);

        // By default, we only add text fields that are 'visible' to users (where the content is directly visible on 
        // the website), along with the 'meta' fields that are commonly used to boost / refine search results
        $this->addFulltextField('Title');
        $this->addFulltextField('MenuTitle');
        $this->addFulltextField('Content');
        $this->addFulltextField('MetaDescription');
        $this->addFulltextField('ExtraMeta');

        // Adds 'ShowInSearch' boolean field to Solr document so we can later ensure that only documents included in 
        // search are returned by Solr.
        $this->addFilterField('ShowInSearch');

        parent::init();
    }
}
```

This index extends the core `CwpSearchIndex` abstract class, which includes additional functionality specific to CWP.
Please note that if you want to index other database fields or need to create a custom index, it is necessary to extend this base class (`CwpSearchIndex`) in order to use much of the functionality detailed in this section (e.g. spell checking).

*Note:* The line `$this->addFilterField('ShowInSearch');` is a standard requirement for all CWP recipe versions, and will need to be added to any custom indexes created.

If you are using cwp recipe 1.1.0 or below please refer to [version 1.1 and before documentation archive](https://www.cwp.govt.nz/developer-docs/en/1.1/features/solr_search#default-search-index-2) for the index code
