title: Creating forms in the CMS
summary: How to use the Userforms module to create forms via the CMS

# Userforms

Userforms allows a CMS user to create and edit an email submission form without needing to know any code. You have the ability to add [fields](https://userhelp.silverstripe.org/en/optional_features/forms/field-types), save [form submissions](https://userhelp.silverstripe.org/en/optional_features/forms/form-submissions/) which can then be viewed and exported via the CMS and set up automated emails once a submission takes place.

As a developer you can extend existing fields to create your own fields which are added by a user and also prefill form fields by passing values via the url (e.g. http://yoursite.com/formpage?EditableField1=MyValue).

For more information about the userforms module go to the [github repository](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-userforms) and go to [user documentation](https://userhelp.silverstripe.org/en/optional_features/forms/) for more information about setting up a form in the CMS.

# Setup

The userforms module is already included as part of the cwp default installation. To set up a form in the CMS visit the [user documentation](https://userhelp.silverstripe.org/en/optional_features/forms/creating-and-editing-forms).

# Technical

There are some extra configuration options and [security](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-userforms/blob/master/docs/en/installation.md#file-uploads-and-security) notes to review.
