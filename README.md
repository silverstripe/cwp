## Bugtracker

[issue reporting guidelines](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/issues_and_bugs/).

## Contributing

If you would like to make changes to the SilverStripe core codebase, extra modules or the CWP core codebase, we have
an extensive [guide to contributing code](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/code).

### Translations

Translations of the natural language strings are managed through a third party translation interface, transifex.com.
Newly added strings will be periodically uploaded there for translation, and any new translations will be merged
back to the project source code.

Please use https://www.transifex.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-cwp/ to contribute translations, rather than sending
pull requests with YAML files.

See the ["i18n" topic](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/developer_guides/i18n/) on docs.silverstripe.org for more
details.
